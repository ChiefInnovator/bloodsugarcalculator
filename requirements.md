# eAG/A1C Calculator Requirements Analysis

## Conversion Formulas

Based on the American Diabetes Association calculator, the following formulas are used:

1. **A1C to eAG (mg/dL)**: 
   - Formula: eAG (mg/dL) = 28.7 × A1C - 46.7
   
2. **A1C to eAG (mmol/L)**:
   - Formula: eAG (mmol/L) = (28.7 × A1C - 46.7) / 18
   - Note: The conversion factor from mg/dL to mmol/L is 1/18

3. **eAG (mg/dL) to A1C**:
   - Formula: A1C = (eAG (mg/dL) + 46.7) / 28.7

4. **eAG (mmol/L) to A1C**:
   - Formula: A1C = ((eAG (mmol/L) × 18) + 46.7) / 28.7

## Functional Requirements

1. **Core Functionality**:
   - Allow users to input either eAG (mg/dL or mmol/L) or A1C (%)
   - Display the converted result with clear labels and units
   - Implement error handling for invalid inputs (negative values, non-numeric inputs, etc.)
   - Support bidirectional conversion (A1C to eAG and eAG to A1C)
   - Support both mg/dL and mmol/L units for eAG

2. **User Interface**:
   - Create a clean, responsive design suitable for both desktop and mobile devices
   - Implement an intuitive interface with clear input fields and results display
   - Include tooltips or help icons for technical terms
   - Use a modern, accessible design with appropriate color contrast

3. **Educational Content**:
   - Provide concise, accessible sections explaining:
     - What blood glucose measurements (eAG and A1C) represent and their clinical significance
     - Factors that positively affect blood sugar control (e.g., diet, exercise, medication adherence)
     - Factors that negatively impact blood sugar (e.g., stress, poor diet, illness)

## Technical Requirements

1. **Implementation**:
   - Use HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for a static web application
   - Ensure the application works without server-side processing
   - Make the application easily deployable to Azure Static Web Apps
   - Ensure the code is maintainable and well-documented

2. **Responsive Design**:
   - Implement responsive design principles for all screen sizes
   - Ensure the calculator is usable on mobile devices
   - Test on multiple browsers and devices

3. **Accessibility**:
   - Ensure the application is accessible to users with disabilities
   - Implement proper ARIA attributes and semantic HTML
   - Ensure sufficient color contrast for readability

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**:
   - The calculator should provide instant results without noticeable delay
   - The application should load quickly, even on slower connections

2. **Maintainability**:
   - Code should be well-structured and documented
   - Use modular design patterns for easier maintenance
   - Include comments explaining complex calculations or logic

3. **Compatibility**:
   - The application should work on all modern browsers
   - No dependencies on external services that might become unavailable
